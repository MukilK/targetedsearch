A framework for finding the best match based on the weight of attributes.

An example scenario- For a job search -> The Poster can create a new job post with required skills. 
Each of the skills will have weights assigned.
A candidate creates a profile with his skills, he can score his skill from 0 to 10 (10 being really strong on the skill).
The framework finds and returns the profiles best suited for the candidate.

Future improvements- add support for Location, salary etc...
Make it more generic -> can be used for dating and matching sites too.
